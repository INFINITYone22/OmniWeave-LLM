# Multimodal LLM Architecture

This repository contains the architecture and design documents for a large-scale (target ~88B parameters) multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), capable of processing and generating text, and designed to be compatible with image and audio modalities.

The model architecture is designed with FP4 precision as a target for inference, assuming appropriate hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GB200 with Transformer Engine) and specialized software libraries for actual quantization. The provided Python code implements the model structure using standard PyTorch modules.

## Overview

The model combines several key components:

*   **Customizable Transformer Layers:** Based on PyTorch's `nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`.
*   **FlashAttention (Conceptual):** A simplified placeholder for FlashAttention is included in the multimodal architecture, assuming an optimized kernel for efficiency.
*   **VQ-VAE:** A vector quantization variational autoencoder for encoding images into discrete tokens (part of the multimodal architecture).
*   **Modality Encoders:** Separate encoders for text, images (ViT-like), and audio (simplified CNN) are defined in the multimodal architecture.
*   **Transformer Backbone:** A stack of transformer layers for processing the combined multimodal embeddings.

## File Structure

*   `multimodal_llm_architecture.py`: Contains the main multimodal model architecture, including `ModelConfig`, various encoders, VQ-VAE, and the main `MultimodalLLM` class.
*   `large_transformer.py`: Defines a `LargeTransformer` class, primarily text-focused, showcasing a large-scale encoder structure.
*   `multimodal_llm_design.md`: A markdown file describing the comprehensive design philosophy for an 88B parameter multimodal LLM.
*   `transformer_model_config.md`: A markdown file containing an example transformer model configuration for a GB200 Superchip.
*   `model_description.txt`: A detailed text file discussing the design of an 80B parameter dense multimodal model, including considerations for FP4.
*   `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.
*   `80b/`: Contains older or alternative versions of code.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual URL
    cd System-Design-for-Large-Multimodal-Language-Model-
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you have a compatible version of PyTorch installed for your hardware (CPU/GPU). Refer to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) for installation instructions.*

## Configuration

The main model configuration for the multimodal architecture is defined in the `ModelConfig` dataclass within `multimodal_llm_architecture.py`.

Key parameters in `ModelConfig` include:
*   `text_vocab_size`: Size of the text vocabulary (e.g., 128,000).
*   `vq_codebook_size`: Number of discrete tokens in the VQ-VAE codebook for images (e.g., 8,192).
*   `dim`, `num_layers`, `num_heads`, `ffn_dim`: Core Transformer dimensions.
*   `max_seq_len`: Maximum sequence length the model can handle.
*   `vq_codebook_dim`: Dimensionality of VQ-VAE codebook vectors.
*   `image_size`, `patch_size`: Image encoder (ViT-like) parameters.
*   `audio_conv_kernel`, `audio_conv_stride`: Audio encoder parameters.

The `large_transformer.py` also has its own set of configurable parameters in its `__init__` method, including `vocab_size` (intended for text).

## Usage

The `multimodal_llm_architecture.py` script includes an example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrating how to:
1.  Initialize the `ModelConfig` (with smaller dimensions for local testing).
2.  Instantiate the `MultimodalLLM`.
3.  Create dummy input tensors for text, image, and audio.
4.  Perform a forward pass to get logits.
5.  Generate a sequence of token IDs autoregressively using the `generate` method (e.g., for text generation).

You can run the script directly to see this example:
```bash
python multimodal_llm_architecture.py
```
*Note: The default configuration in the script's example uses significantly smaller dimensions for feasibility on standard hardware. The large-scale parameters (e.g., 88B) discussed in the design documents require substantial computational resources (multiple high-end GPUs/TPUs) and distributed training frameworks (not included here).*

## Example Snippet (Conceptual from `multimodal_llm_architecture.py` example)

This illustrates how one might initialize the `MultimodalLLM` and use it, adapted from the example block in the script.

```python
import torch
from multimodal_llm_architecture import ModelConfig, MultimodalLLM

# 1. Initialize configuration (using example small values)
config = ModelConfig(
    dim=512,
    num_layers=4,
    num_heads=8,
    ffn_dim=2048,
    max_seq_len=512,
    text_vocab_size=20000,    # Example text vocabulary
    vq_codebook_size=1024,   # Example image token vocabulary
    vq_codebook_dim=128,
    image_size=64,
    patch_size=16
)

# 2. Initialize model
model = MultimodalLLM(config)

# 3. Create Dummy Inputs
batch_size = 2
text_seq_len = 32
image_size = config.image_size
audio_seq_len = 2000 # Example audio length

dummy_text = torch.randint(0, config.text_vocab_size, (batch_size, text_seq_len))
dummy_image = torch.randn(batch_size, 3, image_size, image_size)
# dummy_audio = torch.randn(batch_size, 1, audio_seq_len) # Audio input

# 4. Forward Pass
# Logits for the combined vocabulary (text + image tokens)
logits = model(text_tokens=dummy_text, images=dummy_image) #, audio=dummy_audio)
print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}")

# 5. Generation Example (e.g., text)
prompt = torch.randint(0, config.text_vocab_size, (1, 10)) # Single text prompt
generated_tokens = model.generate(text_prompt=prompt, max_new_tokens=20)
print(f"Generated Token IDs (first prompt): {generated_tokens[0].tolist()}")
