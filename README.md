# Multimodal LLM Architecture

This repository contains the code for an 88B parameter multimodal LLM, capable of generating text and images.

## Overview

The model combines several key components:

*   **FlashAttention:**  An efficient attention mechanism for faster training and inference.
*   **VQ-VAE:**  A vector quantization variational autoencoder for encoding images into discrete tokens.
*   **Modality Encoders:**  Encoders for processing text, images, and audio inputs.
*   **Transformer Backbone:**  A stack of transformer layers for processing the combined embeddings.

## File Structure

*   `multimodal_llm_architecture.py`:  Contains the main model architecture.
*   `large_transformer.py`: Contains the code for the transformer layers.
*   `multimodal_llm_design.md`:  A markdown file describing the comprehensive design of the LLM.
*   `transformer_model_config.md`: A markdown file containing the transformer model configuration.
*   `model_description.txt`: A text file describing the model.
*   `80b/`: Contains older versions of the code.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Ensure you have a compatible version of PyTorch installed for your hardware (CPU/GPU). Refer to the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/) for installation instructions.*

## Configuration

The main model configuration is defined in the `ModelConfig` dataclass within `multimodal_llm_architecture.py`. You can modify these parameters directly in the script or adapt the code to load configuration from a file (e.g., YAML or JSON) for more complex setups.

Key parameters include:
*   `dim`, `num_layers`, `num_heads`, `ffn_dim`: Core Transformer dimensions.
*   `vocab_size`: Size of the text vocabulary.
*   `max_seq_len`: Maximum sequence length the model can handle.
*   `vq_codebook_size`, `vq_codebook_dim`: VQ-VAE parameters.
*   `image_size`, `patch_size`: Image encoder parameters.

## Usage

The `multimodal_llm_architecture.py` script includes an example `if __name__ == "__main__":` block demonstrating how to:
1.  Initialize the `ModelConfig` (with smaller dimensions for testing).
2.  Instantiate the `MultimodalLLM`.
3.  Create dummy input tensors for text, image, and audio.
4.  Perform a forward pass.
5.  Generate text tokens autoregressively using the `generate` method.

You can run the script directly to see this example:
```bash
python multimodal_llm_architecture.py
```
*Note: The default configuration in the script uses smaller dimensions for feasibility. The large-scale parameters (88B) mentioned require significant computational resources (multiple high-end GPUs/TPUs) and distributed training frameworks like DeepSpeed or Megatron-LM.*

## Example

```python
import torch
from multimodal_llm_architecture import MultimodalLLM

# Initialize model
model = MultimodalLLM(
    vocab_size=58192,  # 50,000 text + 8,192 image tokens
    dim=8192,
    num_layers=110,
    num_heads=64,
    ffn_dim=32768
)

# Dummy inputs
text_tokens = torch.randint(0, 50000, (1, 128))  # Random text prompt
image = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)  # Dummy 256x256 image

# Forward pass (training mode)
logits = model(text_tokens=text_tokens, images=image)
print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}")

# Generate image (inference mode)
generated_image = model.generate(text_tokens)
print(f"Generated image shape: {generated_image.shape}")
```
